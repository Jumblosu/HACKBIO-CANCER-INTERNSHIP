**IMMUNE CHECKPOINT (BIOMARKER DISCOVERY)**

Immune checkpoints are key regulators of the immune system which are located on the surfaces of Immune cells such as T lymphocytes. They bind to their respective ligands expressed on the tumor cell surface, thereby regulating immune responses. These immune checkpoints can either be stimulatory or inhibitory, and their major role is to help prevent autoimmunity. Autoimmunity occurs when the immune cells mistakenly attack the healthy body cells, due to detection of healthy body cells as foreign antigens. Immune checkpoints help to maintain immune homeostasis (Kamali *et al.,* 2023).

There are two major groups of Immune checkpoints which are:

**Costimulatory Checkpoint Molecules:** These are receptors on T cells that binds to their respective ligands on antigen presenting cells to stimulate T cells during an Immune response to foreign antigens such as cancer. Examples include CD28 that binds to CD80 and CD86

**Co inhibitory Checkpoint Molecules**: They regulate the immune response by slowing down or downregulating an immune response to prevent excessive responses to cancer cells. Examples include PD1 and CTL4A

 Biomarkers related to immune checkpoints such as PD1 and CTLA4 have been targeted in cancer diagnostics and immunotherapy. These biomarkers are significant because they often suppress T lymphocyte activities, which are essential for combating cancer. To effectively target these receptors, it is essential to understand their mechanisms of action:

PD-1 (programmed Death -1): It is expressed on tumor specific T cells and becomes upregulated when T cell is activated. It binds to PD-1 ligand and when bound, it limits T cell response. Cancer cells exploit this pathway to evade immune checkpoints by expressing high level of PD-1 ligand. When these ligands bind to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the T cells become inactivated thereby leading to metastasis and gr (Naylor *et al.,* 2016)

CTLA-4: Cancer cells also exploit this immune checkpoint by increasing the level of CTLA-4 expression on T cells which when bound to its ligand which are the CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte becomes suppressed, and cancer growth spread

Immune Scientists have used this knowledge to produce checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors (Nivolumab), PDL-1 inhibitors: Durvalumab and Avelumab, and CTLA-4 inhibitor: pilimumab . The mechanism of action involves targeting the receptors and binding to the receptors, so they do not bind to their respective ligand, thereby preventing the suppression of cytotoxic t cell in cancer immune response (Shiravand *et al*., 2022).
